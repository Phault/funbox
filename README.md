# Funbox
Funbox is a silly physics playground.

The 'game', or whatever you would like to call it, was made to get myself familiar with the [libGDX] gamedev framework and the [Artemis-odb] ECS framework.

A lot of the reuseable code has been moved to its own repository at [libgdx-artemis-essentials].

### Downloads
An online version of the game can be found [here](http://archoninteractive.com/school/funbox/) along with download links for offline versions in the footer.
